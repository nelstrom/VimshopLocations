Environment vars
----------------

To fetch records from the MailChimp API, we need to configure an API key, and specify the ID of the subscriber list. These are stored as environment variables.

Set these up on your development environment by running these (or paste them into your .bash_profile):

    export MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=abc123
    export WORKSHOP_LIST_ID=321bca

Set these up on heroku by running:

    heroku config:add MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=abc123
    heroku config:add WORKSHOP_LIST_ID=321bca
